Subqueries : Are query within a query which can be nested
             We have to enclose the subqueries in parenthesis
             Place subqueries on the right hand side of the comparision operator
             Always the inner query selects the attribute that is required by the outer query
             We have to use single row operators with single row subquery and
             Multi row operators with multi row subquery

Single Row subqueries : return one value
  operators : =, >,<,>=,<=,<>

Multi Row subqueries : return more than one value
  operators : in, any, all in conjunction with the single row operators

Corelated Sub Queries : is a way of reading every row of the table and comaparing values in each row against related data
                        It is used whenever a subquery must return a different result or set of results for each row value by the main query

Normal Subquery : The inner select query executes once and returns the value to the outer query. It is then removed from the memory

Co-related Subquery : The inner query executes once for each candidate row of the outer query. In other words the inner query is driven by the outer query.

Case : 2 types of case
 1. Simple case : 1. case keyword is immediately followed by case expression and before when
                  2. Value exists for each when statement

 2. Searched case : 1. Case keyword is followed by when statement. There is no expression between case and when
                    2. Boolean expression exists for each when statement

 3. Nested case : case inside if else , case inside case


T-Sql (Transact Sql) : declare variables, if else construct, while loops, break, continue

variables are declared using a single '@' symbol  (local variables)
'@@' global variables
--assigning values to local variables is done using 'set' keyword or 'select'
