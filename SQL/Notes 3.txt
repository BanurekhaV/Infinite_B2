Subqueries : Are query within a query which can be nested
             We have to enclose the subqueries in parenthesis
             Place subqueries on the right hand side of the comparision operator
             Always the inner query selects the attribute that is required by the outer query
             We have to use single row operators with single row subquery and
             Multi row operators with multi row subquery

Single Row subqueries : return one value
  operators : =, >,<,>=,<=,<>

Multi Row subqueries : return more than one value
  operators : in, any, all in conjunction with the single row operators

Case : 2 types of case
 1. Simple case : 1. case keyword is immediately followed by case expression and before when
                  2. Value exists for each when statement

 2. Searched case : 1. Case keyword is followed by when statement. There is no expression between case and when
                    2. Boolean expression exists for each when statement

 3. Nested case : case inside if else , case inside case


T-Sql (Transact Sql) : declare variables, if else construct, while loops, break, continue

variables are declared using a single '@' symbol  (local variables)
'@@' global variables
--assigning values to local variables is done using 'set' keyword or 'select'
