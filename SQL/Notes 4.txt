Ranks() - Window Function to rank the rows based on the data value

Indexes : is a mechanism of sorting the data physically within the database schema
They are of 2 types : 
    1. Clustered Index: One per table
                        Sorts the physical data everytime there is a DML Operation

    2. Non-Clustered Index : We can have many non-clustered index for a table
                          Creates a index table where the data is sorted
                          Hence occupies hard disk space 
                          Any manipulations done to the table, the index table also has to be updated and sorted accordingly

    3. Filtered Index : is a non-clustered index with a predicate used in situtaions where we need only the portion of the index.
                        

 Unique Clusterd : ensuring no duplicates, sorting the physical table
 Unique Non-Clustered : ensures no duplicates

Transactions : A single unit of work that contains one or more sql statements

Transactions begins with the first DML statement being executed and 
             end with one of the following events
                - A commit or a Rollback is issued
                - Auto Commit
                - The user Exits
                - The system crashes

Transaction management ensures
      - Data Consistency
      - Preview data changes before making it permanent
      - Group logically related operations

All transactions should start with a begin transaction

Save Points/Transaction : Are Logical markers/blocks of a set operations in a transaction

 ACID Properties
A-Atomicity
C-Consistency
I-Isolation       
D-Durability

Locks are of 2 types :1. shared lock, 2. exclusive lock


Stored Procedure :  are saved sql statements
  - can be reused
  - they are faster in performance
  - they are parsed once 
  - they create an execution plan once
  
when called, they simply execute

-Every procedure has an integer return type
-Procedures can take any number of inputs
-Procedures can return output values
