Sql In - The IN statement can be used to find rows in aquery where one column can be matched to a list of values, that can either be hard coded ot can come from a sub query.
-It is easy to understand and use.
-The only downside is that they can only compare single column 

Sql Exists :Tests for existence of rows in the result of a subquery.
- If found the serach does not continue and the condition flags a TRUE
- If not found, the condition flags FALSE and the search continues in the inner query

Eg: To find employees(managers) who have atleast one employee reporting to them
 
select empno,ename,jobid,dept from employees
outeremp where exists(select 'x' from employees inneremp where inneremp.mgrid=outeremp.empno)
 returns a true and stops, or returns a false and continues

Note: 'x' here is a constant used, since the inner query does not return any specific value. Also to improve performance of the query with a constant rather than a column value


Eg : select empno,ename,jobid,dept from employees where
  empno in(select mgr_id from employees where mgrid is not null)

Not Exists :
 Find all depts that do not have any employees
 select deptid,deptname from tbldepartment d
where not exists(select 'x' from tblemployee where deptid=d.deptid)

alternatively we can use not in

SQL : File groups :
Whenever we create a database, the sql server will create only 2 files viz

  1. A data file (.mdf) - primary file group (default group)
  2. A transaction log file (.ldf)

Multiple File Groups : Helps us to stire data in a granular manner

Eg : create database mfgdb on primary
(
--primary group
 Name='mfgdb',
 filename='C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL15.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA\mfgdb.mdf',
 size=5mb;
 maxsize=unlimited,
 filegrowth=1024kb
),

--secondary group
filegroup filegroup1
(
-- 1st file in secondary group
 Name='mfgdbfile1',
  filename='C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL15.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA\mfgdbfile1.ndf',
 size=1mb,
maxsize=unlimited,
 filegrowth=1024kb
),


(
-- 2nd file in secondary group
 Name='mfgdbfile2',
  filename='C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL15.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA\mfgdbfile2.ndf',
 size=1mb,
maxsize=unlimited,
 filegrowth=1024kb
),

Log On
filegroup filegroup1
(
-- Log file in secondary group
 Name='mfgdblogfile1',
  filename='C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL15.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA\mfgdblogfile1.ldf',
 size=5mb,
maxsize=unlimited,
 filegrowth=1024kb
)

--to place any tables that we create on a specific file group, we can give it as below:
create table Customers ( ..,..,..,.. ) on filegroup1

--inorder to make the file group1 as a default file group , so that all the user tables gets created inside that group, we can do as below:

alter database mfgdb modify filegroup filegroup1 default

create table testtable (..,..,..) 

Note : If we insert say about 40,000 records/rows, the resultant size of data will be appx 312 mb
(40,000 * 8kb/1024 = 312)

--each file in the filegroup will receive about 160 MB

SQL Server Profiler : is a GUI Tool that helps to
  -- Step through the queries to find the cause of the problem
  -- Find and diagnose slow running queries
  -- Capture series of t-sql statements that lead to a problem
  -- Monitor the performance

SQL Server Manager : a set of services used to start,stop,pause various components on the sql server

Security Model : Security threats that can affect sql server
  1. Sql Server Authenticatioins - login thru connection string is vulnerable for attacks.
  2. Sql Injection : 
  3. Verbose erros: 
  4. Denial of Service(DOS) :
