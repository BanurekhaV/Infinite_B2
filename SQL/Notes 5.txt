Error Handling : In order to subtly exit out of an erroneous statements/procedures

Error number : is a unique identifier given for each and every error. The value will be below 50000 for predefined system errors and above 50000-2147483647 for user defined error numbers

Error Message : It is piece of brief information describing the error occurred, which should be maximum of 2047 characters

Severity Level : Tells about the importance of the error which can be ranging between 0-24
   0-9 : are not severe. Can be considered as information or status messages
   11-16 : Indicates errors created by the user
   17-19 : are Software errors that cannot be corrected by the user, and must be reported to the admin
   20-24 : are fatal errors, which can damage the database or system. Automatically the database connection is terminated

State : It is an arbitrary value that is not important , and can range between 0-127. We can use this whenever the same error has to occur in multiple places

Raiserror is a function which raises an error with specific error no/id and displays the error message associated with it
 
 raiserror(errorid/errormsg, severity,state) or raiserror(errorid,severity,state,error message)

We can also throw errors :

  throw error_id, errormsg, state

Throw is just throwing an error, while raiserror is raising an error and then throwing

--To add user defined error messages to the already existing sys.messages table, we use the below procedure

sp_addmessage <msgid/errorid>, <severity>, <message>
