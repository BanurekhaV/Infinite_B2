What is Database and DBMS ? : Storage of inter related data that has been organized in such a fashion, that retrieving data is efficient and effective.

Management System is a set of programs to access the data.
An Environment that is both convinient and efficient to use

Need for Database : Drawbacks of using File System to store data :
     - Data Redundance and inconsistency
     - Difficulty in accessing data
     - Data Isolation - Multiple files and formats
     - Integrity Problems
     - Atomicity of Updates
     - Concurrent access by multiple users
     - Security Problems

DBMS : Dbase III, IV, Foxbase, Foxpro
  
No Sql Database : MongoDB

Architecture of Database : 
  1. Physical Level : Describes how a record/data is sroted in the system (Bits and Bytes)
  2. Logical Level : Describes data stored in the database, and thgeir relationships 
   Customer Data : Cust id 1001(int)
                   CustName "AAAA" (string)
 3. Applicational/View Level : Giving away required data and hiding secured data

Data Modeling : A collection of tools for describing
 - Data
 - Data Relationships
 - Data Semantics
 - Data Constraints

  - Hierachial Database (Focus 4GL)
  - Network Database
  - Relational Database : SQL Server, Oracle,MYSQL, Postgress, Informix, Sybase etc.. 
  - Object Relational Database (Multimedia, Hyper Text based Database)

Features of RDBMS : It follows the Relational Data Model. The data is stored in the form of Tables(Rows and Columns).
The table is also known as relation
The Columns are called as attributes (attributes together in a relation is known as 'Domain'
The row is called as 'Tuple'
Number of attributes is known as the 'Degree'
Number of rows is known as 'Cardinality'

E-R Modelling :
Entity : is anything that exists and is distinguishable
Entity Set : a group of similar entities
Attribute : properties that describe an entity
Relationships : an association between entities
  Types of Relationships :
     - One to One   Eg : Student is issued one ID Card
     - One to Many  Eg : One student can enrol for many courses
     - Many to Many Eg : Many Students take many Tests

Structured Query Language : 5 Components
1. Data Definition Language (DDL) - Create, Alter,Drop,Truncate
2. Data Manipulation Language (DML) - Insert, Delete, Update
3. Data Query Language (DQL) - Select
4. Data Control Language (DCL) - Grant, Revoke
5. Transaction Control language (TCL) - Commit, Rollback

Table : 
create table <table name>
( Colname, datatype size, constraints,
...
..
)

//to View the data
select * from <tablename> (* indicates all rows and columns)

Keys Concept : columns, which have special meaning
 - Primary Key : a candidate key chosen as a principal means of identifying tuples within a relation.
    - is a key which cannot have null values nor duplicate values.
    
 - Composite Key : a key that has more than 1 attribute
 - Composite Primary Key : a primary key made up of more than one column

 - Unique Key : is like a primary key but can take one null

Integrity Constraints in DBMS : Constraints are the rules enforced on the data columns of a table. These are used to limit the type of data that can get into the table. This way we can ensure accuracy and reliabilty of the data in the database

 -There are 3 types of constraint :
    1. Domain Integrity Constraint : States that every element from a relation should respect the type and restrictions attached to the attribute (Eg. Default, Check)
    2. Entity Integrity Constraint : States that no primary key can contain null values (primary key)
    3. Referential Integrity : States that maintaining consistency among 2 or more relations is a must in RDBMS (Foreign key)

 - default constraint : is a default value being set for a column, which will be used in case we do not supply value for the column

 - Check Constraint : is used to validate the data that is being given thru insert/update commands against the constraint

 - Foreign key : a key in one relation that must have a primary key reference in another relation
   - Foreign keys will always look up to the primary key for its values. It is dependent on the pk value
   - They can be duplicates
   - They can be null
