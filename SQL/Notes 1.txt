What is Database and DBMS ? : Storage of inter related data that has been organized in such a fashion, that retrieving data is efficient and effective.

Management System is a set of programs to access the data.
An Environment that is both convinient and efficient to use

Need for Database : Drawbacks of using File System to store data :
     - Data Redundance and inconsistency
     - Difficulty in accessing data
     - Data Isolation - Multiple files and formats
     - Integrity Problems
     - Atomicity of Updates
     - Concurrent access by multiple users
     - Security Problems

DBMS : Dbase III, IV, Foxbase, Foxpro
  
No Sql Database : MongoDB

Architecture of Database : 
  1. Physical Level : Describes how a record/data is sroted in the system (Bits and Bytes)
  2. Logical Level : Describes data stored in the database, and thgeir relationships 
   Customer Data : Cust id 1001(int)
                   CustName "AAAA" (string)
 3. Applicational/View Level : Giving away required data and hiding secured data

Data Modeling : A collection of tools for describing
 - Data
 - Data Relationships
 - Data Semantics
 - Data Constraints

  - Hierachial Database (Focus 4GL)
  - Network Database
  - Relational Database : SQL Server, Oracle,MYSQL, Postgress, Informix, Sybase etc.. 
  - Object Relational Database (Multimedia, Hyper Text based Database)

Features of RDBMS : It follows the Relational Data Model. The data is stored in the form of Tables(Rows and Columns).
The table is also known as relation
The Columns are called as attributes (attributes together in a relation is known as 'Domain'
The row is called as 'Tuple'
Number of attributes is known as the 'Degree'
Number of rows is known as 'Cardinality'

E-R Modelling :
Entity : is anything that exists and is distinguishable
Entity Set : a group of similar entities
Attribute : properties that describe an entity
Relationships : an association between entities
  Types of Relationships :
     - One to One   Eg : Student is issued one ID Card
     - One to Many  Eg : One student can enrol for many courses
     - Many to Many Eg : Many Students take many Tests
