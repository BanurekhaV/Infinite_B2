Data Types : Supports almost all the data types
  Char, varchar() text, ntext, nvarchar, nvarchar(max), int, float, decimal, double, numeric
  date, datetime, year, image, real, bool,

Integrity Constraints on the columns of the Table
 1. Primary Key
 2. Unique Key
 3. Foreign Key
 4. Not Null
 5. Default
 6. Check

- the above constraints can de declared either at column level or at the table level

-Identity key column : is like a primary key because it does not accomodate nulls or duplicates
  - The data is inserted automatically using the seed and the increment value
  - The default seed is 1 and the increment value is 1 (we can change the seed and increment value)
  - Can be applied to integer datatypes

Relational Algebra
 Selection  - Restriction (where) no of rows/tuples/records
 Projection - Restriction of no.of columns
 Join
 Union
 Difference
 Divide

Column Alias name : is used to display proper meaningful column names so that the user can understand it better
 - can be followed by the actual column name with or without the key word 'as'. 
 - has to be enclosed in a single quote if there is space between the words, else not required

--Various operatotrs in the Select Clause
 

Difference between Drop and Truncate

Drop : will remove the object from the database itself
Truncate : will retain the object structure, but will only delete the rows

Delete                     vs                  Truncate

- DML command                                   DDL command
- We can Rollback				We cannot rollback
- Delete can have restrictions			No restrictions, complete delete
    with a where clause
- it is slow compared to truncate               It is faster
- It retains the structure, even after all      It also retains the structure
    records/rows are deleted

--sorting of data for display purpose
--order by clause is by default ascending (asc)
-- we can specify 'desc' for descending order
-- we can sort multiple columns with a ',' seperation
-- we can sort on alias names
-- we can sort on columns that are not a part of the select statement

Sql Functions: Single Row Functions - operates on each row and returns one result per row
               Multiple Row Functions - operates on group of rows and returns one result per group

upper
concat
length
substr

Group By : To categorize the data into several small groups/sections, we use group by clause
-- we have to group on all the columns that is in the select list except for the aggreagated column
-- we cannot group on the columns that is not in select list
-- we cannot group on alias names of the columns


--order of the query

select .... from ...where.. group by .. having... order by..

--order of the query execution
1. from
2. where
3. group by
4. having
5. order by
6. select

Where clause                   vs              Having Clause

restrictions on the rows                       restrictions on the group

--Queries involving more than one table
