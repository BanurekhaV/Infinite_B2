- the above constraints can de declared either at column level or at the table level

-Identity key column : is like a primary key because it does not accomodate nulls or duplicates
  - The data is inserted automatically using the seed and the increment value
  - The default seed is 1 and the increment value is 1 (we can change the seed and increment value)
  - Can be applied to integer datatypes
