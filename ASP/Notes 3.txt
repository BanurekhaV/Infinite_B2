Caching : is a mechanism of storing pages/ some parts of the page for later retrieval. Caching helps in Server Performance, by avoiding round trips to the server. 

Server.Transfer and Response.Redirect : Both are meant for navigation from one to another page

Response.Redirect : the page is redirected permanently
                    used to navigate within the same application as well as from one application to another
                    The url is changed in the address bar. We can even bookmark the url
                    Extra Round trip happens to the server after redirecting saying page redirection done
                    We can redirect to even html pages


Server.Transfer : The page is not redirected permanently
                  Used to navigate only within the same application and not outside
                  The Url is not changed, because the second page is processed from within the first page
                  There is no extra round trip to the server. Sever resources are saved
                   It is only used to navigate with ASP or ASP.net Page and not Html pages



Exception Handling : While exception handling is a part and parcel of any application development. .net framework provides with a set of rich standard exceptions


The various Events of the Application :
1. Application_Start
2. Session_Start
3. Session_End
4. Application_Error
5. Application_End

Apart from the various page events, we also can handle Page_Error event for respective handle

Errors can be handled at 1. Page, 2. Application Level, 3. Custom level
