ASP.Net : a Web Development platform, that provides programming model, software infrastructure and various services required to build web applications for PC/Laptop or mobile devices
-Other similar technologies are :
   PHP
  JAVA
  CGI
  PERL
  RUBY on RAILS

Web Form : also known as a web page, is the core component of asp applications
- It has a code behind file with an extension .aspx.cs(c#), .aspx.vb(Visual Basic), that contains the code that the user writes
- It has Designer Files with an extension .aspx.designer.cs (autogenerated code, not to change)
- A webform/page is associated with the code behind file using a directive @page

Model of ASP.net web form
 - Event driven
 - Browser is the default client
 - Accessible anywhere with internet
 - Client-Server architecture
 - Clients Request/response is done thru Http (a stateless protocol)
        - Page State:contains all inputs in the web form
        - Session State : collective information of various pages of a particular user

All web Applications have to be hosted on a web server:
      -IIS
      -Tomcat
      -Apache
      -WebSphere
      -JellyFish
 

Page Life Cycle : WebForms/Page live barely for a moment.
  When a request is received : 
         a) The instance of the requested page is created
         b) Events are processed
         c) Generates the HTML and Posts it to the client
         d) The webform is immediately destroyed

Life Cycle :
S : Start the page
I : Intialiazation (all controls and other container objects)
L : Load
V : Validate
E : Event handling
R : Render (Css/Html/UI are applied)

Page Events :
 Pre-Init
 Init
 InitComplete
 OnPreLoad
 Load
 LoadComplete
 OnPreRender
 Render
 Unload

Application Life Cycle :
 Application_Start : all global variables and default values are set
 ObjectCreation : HttpContext object, HttpRequest object, HttpResponse object
 HttpApplication Creation : Created by the web server, inorder to process subsequent requests
 Dispose : This event is called before the application instance is destroyed
 Application_End : application is unloaded from the memory

HttpGet: first time request to the server for a page is Get

HttpPost : is a post back event (in response to users query data)

Inorder to understand and appreciate the page events, we can enable the trace to true 
in web.config file under<system.web> tag

This will create a trace.axd file which traces all the events and the request response states
