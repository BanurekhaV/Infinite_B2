State Management: Managing /Retaining the state of the page (data management)

There are 2 types of statemanagement techniques : 

Client Side  :
  1. ViewState: Is a dictionary object that can store any data. 
                It is a simple variable that does not require typecasting.
                It is stored at the client side
                Can retain values (state of the controls) across multiple postbacks of the same page

Note : All asp controls(server controls) have a viewstate field to retain postback events. This is a serialized base64-encoded strings and is stored in  a hidden field

  2. Hidden Fields: Are controls in the tool box.
                    They are not visible at the runtime and only seen at the design time
                    It is a class and hence needs to be initialized
                    More load on the system
                    Can retain values (state of the controls) across multiple postbacks of the same page

Note : While both ViewState Variables and HiddenField Controls work in the same manner, if we have less data/values to manage state, then may be we can use Hiddenfields. If more data has to be managed, then Viewstate is preferred (performance)
Both are local to the form/page

  3. Cookies: Are used when we want our data to travel across pages. Are of 2 types 
             1. Persistent Cookies : We need to use a HttpCookies class object
             2. Non-Persistent Cookies : no need for the httpcookies object

  4. Query String:    
                            
Server Side :
  1. Session State:
  2. Application State:
