What is World Wide Web?
- Network of Information
   - A Uniform Naming Scheme for locating resources on the web (URI's)
   - Protocols, for access to the named resources over the web (Http)
   - Hypertext, for easy navigation among resources (Html)

Every Resource available on the web viz.
   --HTML doc, Images, Video Clips,Program etc has an address that may be accessed by a URI

EG :http://www.mypage.com/mydata

URI's typically have 3 pieces
1. The Protocol (naming scheme) to access the resource
2. The name of the machine hosting the resource  (domain name)
3. The name of the resource itself, given as path

URI has (URN || URL)
URN defines an items identity, while the URL provides a method for finding it
