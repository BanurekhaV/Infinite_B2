Model : Is Responsible for keeping data, Operation Logic like connecting retrieving data from database/class and oblects


Controller : Responsible for all programming logic
- acts like a bridge between view and model
- works with http request that comes from the browser
- all controllers should have controller name suffixed with "controller" keyword
- have action methods 

Action Methods: Actionable code that are always
  - Public
  - Cannot be overloaded
  - Cannot be static
  - every controller has atleast one action method (index()) that returns a view
  - ActionResult is the base class for all types of actions
       View Result - Represents HTML and Razor Syntax
       Content - Represents Text Result or html result
       Json  - Represent JSON data (used for AJAX appln.)
       Redirect - Represents redirection to a new URL
       FileContentResult - Represents a downloadable file(binary content)
       FilePathResult - "  "  (with a path)
       FileStreamResult - "  "  (with FileStream Object)
       RedirectToAction - Represents navigating to other action methods of same or other controllers
       EmptyResult - Represents No Result


View : Responsible for serving web pages to the user (UI)
  - Creates a seperate folders for each controller of the application with the same name
  - contains all .cshtml files with the same name as that of the action method
  - It is a combination of both html and the C# programming constructs(razor Syntax)

Razor Syntax is a very powerful and easiest way of writing server based code directly into the view pages
 - It is a markup synatx that allows programming code to be embedded
 - Use @{....} block to write C# code
 - All the inline expressions like variables and fuctions starts with "@"
 - Variables are declared with var keyword and all code should end with a semicolon ;
 - All string values are with double quotes "  "
 - Can use HTML for adding html code inside a razor block
 - Comment in Razor syntax are 
     @*  ...  *@
     /*  */
     //
    <!-- ...  -->
 - @model is used for adding and accessing model variables and data into the view page
