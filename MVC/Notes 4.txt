Partial Views: When we need a common part of the User Interface(view) on multiple pages in a web application. 
-It also has an .cshtml extension

Filters : There are 5 types of Filters:
 1. Authentication Filter - OnAuthentication(), OnAuthenticationChallenge()
 2. Authorization Filter - OnAuthorization()
 3. Action Filter  -  OnActionExecuting(), OnActionExecuted()
 4. Result Filter  - OnResultExecuting(), OnResultExecuted()
 5. Exception Filter - OnException()

All the above are derived from the respective Interfaces

Some of the predefined filters are :
[HandleError]
[Authenticate]
[Authorize]

Filters can be applied at the below levels:
 - Global Level (Filters are applicable for all controllers and ActionMethods)
 - Controller Level (Applicable to all ActionMethods of the specific controller)
 - Action Level (Applicable for specific action methods)

Problems with the Predefined HandleError attribute :
  1. We cannot log the errors 
  2. Not possible to handle exceptions raised outside the controller
  3. Scenario-Based exceptions cannot be handled 

The solution to the above problems can be solved using Custom Filters
Example - Exception_Prj
