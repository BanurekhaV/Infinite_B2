Code First Approach :
Repository Pattern : Used to create an abstraction layer between data access logic and the business logic. Follows the Solid Principles (ISP)


Model Validation : Using Annotations
Custom Validations : using classes that inherit from the ValidationAttribute base class


View Models: are models that have few details from various models as in the real-life applications, we will have to display multiple data that are not in the same model

Eg : Employee name, Phone  from Employee Model
     Project Name, StartDate, EndDate from Projects Model
     DeptName from Department Model

The above can also be achieved using Navigation properties of the Models
