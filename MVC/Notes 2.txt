-Viewbag, ViewData, TempData : are used for passing data/information from the controller to the views. 

ViewBag - is a Dynamic Datatype and gets resolved at runtime
        - to pass data from controller to views
        - has a short life, means once it passes the value to the view, it becomes null
        - does not require typecasting

   Eg :
     Viewbag.MyData="This is the Data";
 and to access the above in the view page
   @ViewBag.MyData 

ViewData - to pass data from controller to views
         - has a short life, means once it passes the value to the view, it becomes null
         - Dictionary Object
         - Is derived from ViewDataDictionary
         - Uses key-value pair to store the data
         - Requires Typecasting (as and when required)

   Eg : ViewData["MyData"]="This is the Data";
    and to access
    @ViewData["MyData"]


TempData  - is a Dictionary Object
          - Is derived from TempDataDictionary
          - is alive in subsequent request using a method keep()
          - Internally it uses sessions to store value.
          - We must check for null, before using TempData in order to avoid Runtime Error
          - Can be used to transfer data to other views or other controllers
          - Requires Typecasting (as and when required)


ModelBinding : Binding a model object to the view

Scaffolded Views : are templates supported for performing crud operations

MVC with EF : Database first approach




Passing Data/Info/Values from views to controllers
