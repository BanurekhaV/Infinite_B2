First Create a class Library
Delete the class
Add anew Item WCF Service and name it as HelloService
Observer Service Model is the assembly which has all core functionings for WCF
- It will create an Interface with the same name prefixed with I
- It has Service Contract and Operation contract annotation
- Change the Method as string GetMessage(string name)
- Go to the class and implement the method of the interface

  public string GetMessage(string name)
{
return "Hello" + name; }

- Build it
- Host it (windows form, windows service or IIS)

- add a console application to the same solution as HelloServiceHost
- add a .netassembly service model assembly(system.servicemodel)
- add a reference to the project helloservice

- next configuration for 2 end points
- add new item (application configuration- app.config)

-steps for configuration is available in LTI folder

- set the console as start up
- go to main method and type

static void Main()
{
  using(ServiceHost host=new ServiceHost(typeof(Helloservice.helloservice)))
{
host.open();
cw(Host started.. +Datetime.now.tostring());
console.Read();
}


- after the service is running, create a new asp.net application as webclient
-right click and add service reference (give url 8080 one)

look into the web.config file and find 2 bindings

- next add awebform with a text box, button and label control
- on button click write the below
  HelloService.HelloServiceClient client = new Helloservice.HelloserviceClient("BasicHttpBinding_IHelloService");
label1.text=client.GetMessage(TextBox1.text);


-- create new windows forms application , add service refernce and have textbox,button,label and on button click do the same and use the netbinding)

Every Endpoint will need to have 3 things (ABC) address, binding and contract.

End points is basically where the services request are listened and rendered
