Files : A Physical format that stores data permanently on the hard disk. Managed by the OS. In order to persist the data (save the data)
  Serialization : It is the process of converting an objects data into a form that can be stored on a file, database, memory, or transferred thru the network. 
To be able to reuse.
   
   DeSerialization : It is the reverse process of serialization, Where stream of bytes are converted back into an object

  Type of Serialization :
1. Binary Serialization
2. XML Serialization
3. Soap Serialization
4. JSON Serialization " name/value
       Eid, Ename  {"Eid" : 12, "Ename" : "Infinite"}
Namespaces : Sustem.IO

Threads : System.Threading namespace

States of a Thread : 1. Unstarted, 2. Runnable, 3. Running, 4, Not Runnable, 5 Dead 

Important properties and Methods:
 - CurrentThread
 - IsAlive
 - Name
 - ThreadState

Sleep()
Join()
Abort()
Suspend()
Resume()
Start()

Thread Synchronization : Protecting access of critical/crucial data by using various methods as below : 
  - Blocking 
  - Locking
  - Signalling
  - Join
  - lock

Thread Pool :is a collection of threads that can be reused to perform job/activity. ThreadPool class with one of its method called QueueUserWorkItem(WaitCallBack(SomeMethod) will help in getting a thread from the pool to execute. If there are no threads available in the pool, then it queues the method to be executed until a thread is available.


Task : Are program components(functions/methods) that make the application more responsive. Task objects typically are executed asynchronously on a thread pool, rather than synchronously on the main thread.


Task Parallel Library : is a set of public types and API's (TPL).
They simplify the job of developers, and allow parallel programming
  - is a type of programming in which executions are carried out simultaneously
  - The task must be independent
  - Order of execution does not matter

Thread                     Vs                  		     Task 
- A class for creating and 				is an asynchronous operation as a part of TPL
   manipulating work flow
- No direct mechanism to return the 			The task can return a result
  result from a thread
- They can have only one task running at a time		They can have multiple tasks happening at the same time
                                                        
                                                        Implementation using async and await keywords
							Task is a higher level concept of threads
