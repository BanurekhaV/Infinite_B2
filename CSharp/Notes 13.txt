 - Iterators : is a method which is used in an array or collections to retrieve the elements one by one. 
- it uses the yield statement along with return to return the element.
- If we want to stop the iteration, we use yield break
- The return type of the Iterator is IEnumerable, IEnumerable<T>, IEnumerator, IEnumerator<T>
- Points to remember :
    1. Iterators can be used as a method, or as a property (get accessor)
    2. Cannot use iterators in evenst, constructors, finalizers
    3. yield is not a reserved word, but when we use it along the return or break statements, it conveys a special meaning
    4. We can use multiple yield statements
    5. Can be used with generic and non-generic collections

 - Local Functions : Whenever we want to execute some piece of code multiple times, then we can put those codes in an inner function known as Local Function. 
 - We can then call the inner function from the parent/outer function again and again
