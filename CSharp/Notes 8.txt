 Limitations of Arrays are that, they belong to the same data type, and they have a fixed size, which is determined initially. 

Collections : Are classes in C# which are specialized for data storage and retrieval.
They are not size constrained
They get allocated with dynamic memory
They can add or remove elements dynamically wuthout any logic for shifting

Common Collection Classes :
   1. ArrayList : Similar to Arrays, but can be used to store values of different types. No Specific size.
   2. HashTables : generally used in Search Operation of huge data
       Stores Key/Vaue pairs, where the key can be of any data type and value can be of any data type
       Uses a Hashing technique to sort and store the keys, which is neither in the sorted order nor in inserted order
       Key cannot be null or duplicate, but values can be
       The collection iterate either with the key or with value
       If we have to iterate the entire collection, then we use DictionaryEntry structure 
   3. SortedList : Similar to HashTable, but it sorts the key alpahbetically or numerically
       The collection iterate either with the key or with value
       If we have to iterate the entire collection, then we use DictionaryEntry structure 
   4. Stacks : Last-in-First-Out mechanism
   5. Queues : First-in-First-out ""
