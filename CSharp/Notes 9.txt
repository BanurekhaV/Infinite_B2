Various Interfaces that aid in collections :

IEnumerable is an Interface which has one method called GetEnumerator(). This method returns a type of IEnumerator, which is another interface

IEnumerator has 1 property called current that gives the data at the current position, and 2 fumctions viz MoveNext(), and Reset(). These 2 functions help in navigating the collections. MoveNext() function returns true if there are elements in the collection, else false.

Both the above interfaces are meant for iterating a collection. IEnumerable is simpler than IEnumerator.

IComparable : interface has one method called CompareTo(Object o) that takes an object to compare with and return an int
     0 = both are equal
     -1 = first object is smaller than the second
     1 = first object is larger than the second

IComparer : is another interface used to compare objects. This interface has a method called compare(obj1, obj2) that takes 2 objects and return an int as above

is and as statements

is =  a is b ? = checking if a and b are same
as = a as b = making a as a b type


Equality Operations : ==, Equals(), ReferenceEquals, CompareTo

== operator and Equals() function check for the values

ReferenceEquals() checks for instance references
