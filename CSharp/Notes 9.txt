Various Interfaces that aid in collections :

IEnumerable is an Interface which has one method called GetEnumerator(). This method returns a type of IEnumerator, which is another interface

IEnumerator has 1 property called current that gives the data at the current position, and 2 fumctions viz MoveNext(), and Reset(). These 2 functions help in navigating the collections. MoveNext() function returns true if there are elements in the collection, else false.

Both the above interfaces are meant for iterating a collection. IEnumerable is simpler than IEnumerator.
