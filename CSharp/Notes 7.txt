Interface : Interfaces are like classes, which contains properties, methods, delegates, events etc - but only declarations and no implementation
 - Interface members are public by default
 - They do not allow explicit modifiers
 - A class can inherit from one or more Interfaces
 - An interface can inherit from other interfaces
 - The class that inherits from an interface, will have to provide implementation to all the members of the interface
 - We cannot instantiate an instance of an interface, but we can create objects and refer to the derived class/classes

Advantages of Interfaces :
   - Loose coupling
   - Total abstraction
   - component-based programming
   - They act like plug and play features of the application
