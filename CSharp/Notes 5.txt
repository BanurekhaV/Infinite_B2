Inheritance : 
    base keyword
    Name hiding
    Invoking base class constructors thru derived class constructor
    
Types of Constructors : 
   private constructor
   public constructor
   protected constructor
  
   constructor Chain : 'this' keyword is used to call overloaded constructors that belongs to the same class.
     It is usually used to invoke the parameter less/default constructor through a parameterized constructor
 
 static constructor : C# supports 2 types of constructors
     1. Instance Constructor (non-static constructor)
     2. Class Constructor (static constructor)
-static constructors are executed before instance constructors, and after any static fields/member initialization
-static constructors does have any modifiers
-static constructors does not take any parameters
-They cannot be overloaded
-They are called automatically unlike instance constructors
-They are used to initialize static fields/members


Polymorphism :
      OverLoading 
         1. Function
            - functions that have the same name but differ either in the no.of arguments or the data type of the arguments are said to be overloaded functions
            - functions with same type of arguments and same number of arguments , but different return type does not qualify to be overloaded functions
            - Overloading is always seen within a class

         2. Operator
            - When we want to achieve the results of Arithmetic,Logical,Relational,Assignment operators of the  Reference types, same as value types,  we need to overload the specific operator
            


      Overriding 

Structures in C# :
  Are similar to classes
  Can have Parameterized constructors, static constructors,constants,fields, methods,properties, indexers, events, operators etc.
  Structures are internal by default and all the members of the structure are private by default
  Can implement interfaces
