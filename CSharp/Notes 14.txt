Tuples :is a data structure that contains a sequence of elements of different data types.
 - While there are other ways to return multiple values from a method viz: 
  1. Using Custom Types : Creating class with fields/properties and returning the object with multiple data to the caller
  2. Ref and Out: Using ref and out might be a bit complex to understand and implement with good performance. Also they cannot be used with async tasks/methods
  3. Using Dynamic Keyword : Since it is resolved only at the runtime, there will be performance issues due to conversions

  4. Tuple way of returning is more convinient and logical to ensure clean coding and performance

Deconstruction : is splitting up of tuple object into different types and use it later for other function calls/calculations


Pattern matching : is a feature introduced in c# 7.0, that allows us to test an expression for the given pattern. It is Boolean in nature. Either Yes or a No.

 - It allows operations like :
     type checking
     null checking
     comparision
     object deconstruction
     reuse creation (creation pattern)

 is operator : earlier was only used to check compatability of 2 objects

switch pattern : used like a regular switch to branch off logically
switch with when 
case pattern 1:  { }; break;
pattern1=>do something


Extern Aliases : The extern keyword with an alias name is used to avoid conflicts. Give an alias name to the referenecd library assembly and use it with extern alias keyword above the namespaces inclusion

extern alias L1;
extern alias L2;

using System;

Non-Nullable Reference Types / Nullable References : Making the reference types also non-nullable there by avoiding NullReferenceExceptions. It is introduced from C# 8.0 

If we want to give nulls to reference types, then we need use '?' operator to specify the same

Employee ? e = null;
