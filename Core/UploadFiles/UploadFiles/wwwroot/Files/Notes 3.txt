Strings : Is a collection of Characters, represented within double quotes
       Memory is allocated on the heap
       Is  predefined reference type
       Are Immutable
       Have Fixed Size
       Memory cannot be changed dynamically

StringBuilder : Are mutable strings
    
Structures are value type and classes are reference type

Enumerations : User defined Value Type
               It hold a sequence of items known as enumerators
               The value of the first enumerator is 0, which                 		can be changed


Classes and Objects :

Classes are like a blue print of what functionalities and attributes we would want to have

Objects are the instances of the class, using which we can work with the functionalities defined in the class

Constructors : Are Special functions of the class which are meant to initialize the object values(fields)
               Framework provides a default constructor, if our class does not have one
               They have to be either public or internal (access specifiers)
               They have the same name as that of the class
               They do not have any return type
               They can have parameters/arguments
               They can be overloaded (you can have many constructors)
               Are Invoked explicitly

Destructors: Are also function in the class which is used to de-allocate memory
            It has the same name as that of the class, but prefixed with '~'
            There can be only one destructor per class
            They do not take any parameters nor return any type
            They need no access specifier
            We cannot invoke explicitly (it is called automatically when the program looses scope)
