Validations using Ivalidatable Interface's Validate() method - refer example in core folder

Client Side Validation : helps avoid round trips to the server.
                         reduces wait time
                         can give immediate feedback to the user
                         load on the server can be reduced

There are 2 ways to create client side validations

1. Using Javascripts : time consuming and tedious
                       can accept junk values if javascripts are disabled in browser

2. Use Unobtrusive client side validation libraries : Is a predefined js in jquery library. This library uses the server side validation attributes and uses them to implementclient-side validations. So we dont have to write even a single line of custom javascript code. 
We Just need to include the libraries in the specified order

  <script src="~/lib/jquery/jquery.js"></script>
<script src="~/lib/jquery-validation/dist/jquery.validate.min.js"></script>
<script src="~/lib/jquery-validation-unobtrusive/jquery.validate.unobtrusive.min.js"></script>

Custom Validations : refer example in core folder

Remote Validations : Ckecking if the provided email is already used by other user. Such validations can be done only on the server
